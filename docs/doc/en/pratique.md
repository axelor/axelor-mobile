# Good development practices

In order to standardize the mobile application's source code, a number of good development practices were implemented:

- No functionnal logic in the source code.
- Be careful to respect the nomenclature of translation keys.
- Make it easier to understand the contents of a file by giving the same name to the file as to the component inside.
- Generalize code as much as possible for easy reuse.
- Create empowered components from generic components to simplify screen creation and thus facilitate overloading.
