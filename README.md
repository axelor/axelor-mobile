# Presentation

This mobile app is based on [Axelor Open Suite (AOS)](https://github.com/axelor/axelor-open-suite).

The objective is to enable ERP processes to be carried out directly from the phone thanks to simplified screens.

Axelor Open Mobile is a redesign of the [Axelor Mobile](https://github.com/axelor/axelor-mobile-old) application, now obsolete, in React Native. This redesign also contains the addition of new features in addition to better ergonomics.

Based on a modular architecture, the application can be dedicated to a single module or be multidisciplinary.

This new application mobile includes at the moment the following modules with different AOS compatibility:

- Stock management (AOS v6.4+)
- Production (AOS v6.4+)
- CRM (AOS v6.5+)

Working on :

- Human ressources (AOS v7.1+)
- Offline management

# Installation

Please see [installation guide](https://github.com/axelor/axelor-mobile/blob/main/INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md) to get more informations about preriquisites.

# Usage

## Add or remove module for APK generation

Modules can be enabled directly in file App.js from src folder or with settings module from AOS.

To manage apps directly with the _Application_ component, you just need to add/remove Module objects from _modules_ props.

```
import React from 'react';
import {Application} from '@axelor/aos-mobile-core';
import {StockModule} from '@axelor/aos-mobile-stock';
import {ManufacturingModule} from '@axelor/aos-mobile-manufacturing';
import application_properties from '../package.json';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <Application
      modules={[StockModule, ManufacturingModule]}
      mainMenu="auth_menu_user"
      version={application_properties.version}
    />
  );
};

export default App;
```

You can also activate/desactivate apps directly for the configuration module which will be available from AOS v7.0+.
